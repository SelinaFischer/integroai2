        <h3 className="text-foreground font-bold mt-0 mb-2">The Big Question</h3>
        <p className="mb-2"><strong>Automation saved time. But does autonomy create value?</strong></p>
        <p className="mb-0">For years, businesses automated tasks to save time. But today's environment demands more than rule-following — it needs reasoning and adaptability. The future isn't about doing more tasks faster. It's about building systems that can <strong>think</strong>.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>The Big Shift: From Automation to Intelligent Autonomy</h2>
      
      <p>For years, automation helped teams save time by following rules. Workflows became faster. Manual errors decreased. Productivity metrics improved.</p>

      <p>But today's business environment demands more than rule-following — <strong>it needs reasoning and adaptability</strong>.</p>

      <p>Businesses don't just need to automate tasks — they need systems that can think. From finance to supply chain, static automations struggle when conditions change. <strong>AI Agents bring adaptability and context-awareness into business logic.</strong></p>

        <h3 className="text-3xl font-bold text-accent-warm mb-2">The Automation Plateau</h3>
        <p className="text-primary-foreground/90 mb-0">Most automation projects plateau after 12 months, delivering speed but not strategic intelligence</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Why Businesses Get Stuck with Automation</h2>

      <p>Automation delivers three clear benefits:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Faster execution:</strong> Tasks complete in seconds instead of hours</li>
        <li><strong>Fewer errors:</strong> Consistency improves accuracy across operations</li>
        <li><strong>Predictable workflows:</strong> Standardized processes reduce variability</li>
      </ul>

      <p>So why do most automation projects plateau after 12 months?</p>

      <h3>The Problem: Faster Execution ≠ Smarter Operations</h3>

      <p>Traditional automation excels at <strong>executing predefined tasks</strong>, but it fails when:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Conditions change unexpectedly</li>
        <li>Context matters more than rules</li>
        <li>Decisions require judgment, not just speed</li>
      </ul>

      <div className="bg-muted/50 border-l-4 border-accent-warm p-6 rounded-r-lg my-8">
        <p className="mb-2"><strong>Critical Gap:</strong> No visibility into <em>why</em> decisions are made.</p>
        <p className="mb-2">Automation gives you speed. But it doesn't give you insight, adaptability, or strategic intelligence.</p>
        <p className="mb-0"><strong>The result? More output, same bottlenecks.</strong></p>
      </div>

      <h2>What Intelligent Autonomy Looks Like in Practice</h2>

      <p>AI Agents bridge the gap between automation and strategic intelligence — detecting anomalies, rerouting workflows, and prioritizing decisions by business impact <strong>in real time</strong>.</p>

      <h3>Real-World Examples:</h3>

      <p><strong>Finance Operations:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Automation:</strong> Processes invoices based on predefined rules</li>
        <li><strong>AI Agent:</strong> Detects unusual payment patterns, flags potential fraud, suggests optimal payment timing based on cash flow analysis</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Supply Chain Management:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Automation:</strong> Reorders inventory when stock hits threshold</li>
        <li><strong>AI Agent:</strong> Analyzes demand forecasts, supplier lead times, market trends, and dynamically adjusts purchasing decisions</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>Customer Service:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Automation:</strong> Routes tickets based on keywords</li>
        <li><strong>AI Agent:</strong> Understands customer intent, escalates complex issues intelligently, learns from resolution patterns to improve future routing</li>
      </ul>

      <div className="bg-muted/50 border-l-4 border-accent-warm p-6 rounded-r-lg my-8">
        <h3 className="text-foreground font-bold mt-0 mb-2">The Difference</h3>
        <p className="mb-0">Automation follows instructions.<br/>
        <strong>AI Agents understand objectives and adapt to achieve them.</strong></p>
      </div>

      <h2>Readiness Self-Check: Is Your Business Ready to Evolve?</h2>

      <p>Before moving beyond automation, assess your organization's readiness across these three critical dimensions:</p>

      <div className="bg-muted/30 p-6 rounded-xl my-8">
        <h3 className="text-foreground font-bold mt-0 mb-6">AI Agent Readiness Assessment</h3>
        
        <div className="space-y-6">
          <div className="flex gap-4">
            <div className="w-10 h-10 rounded-full bg-accent-warm text-white flex items-center justify-center font-bold shrink-0">1</div>
            <div>
              <h4 className="font-semibold text-foreground mb-1">Measurable KPIs</h4>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-0">Are outcomes tracked beyond completion rates? Do you measure business impact, not just task completion?</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          
          <div className="flex gap-4">
            <div className="w-10 h-10 rounded-full bg-accent-warm text-white flex items-center justify-center font-bold shrink-0">2</div>
            <div>
              <h4 className="font-semibold text-foreground mb-1">Adaptive Systems</h4>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-0">Can your automation learn from feedback? Do your systems improve over time, or do they repeat the same patterns?</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          
          <div className="flex gap-4">
            <div className="w-10 h-10 rounded-full bg-accent-warm text-white flex items-center justify-center font-bold shrink-0">3</div>
            <div>
              <h4 className="font-semibold text-foreground mb-1">Trust & Insights</h4>
              <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-0">Do teams understand and trust AI decisions? Can you explain <em>why</em> a decision was made, not just <em>what</em> was executed?</p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p><strong>If you answered "no" to any of these questions, you're still automating — not evolving.</strong></p>

      <h2>The Strategic Evolution</h2>

      <p>The next competitive advantage isn't about speed — it's about systems that think alongside your business.</p>

      <p>AI Agents don't just complete tasks. They:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Reason:</strong> Interpret objectives and assess context</li>
        <li><strong>Act:</strong> Execute decisions autonomously through connected tools and APIs</li>
        <li><strong>Learn:</strong> Improve performance based on outcomes and feedback</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This shift transforms operations from <strong>reactive execution</strong> to <strong>proactive intelligence</strong>.</p>
